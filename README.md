# **Web Application Systems Assessment Project**
**By: Kathleen**

# **Overview**
As you can tell, this is a basic Django Application for our Year 1 Practical Assessment in Web Application Systems.
It will allow users to view news stories, ordered by the time of publication (most recent first).

Our staff can add stories to the site through the url: https://zshi3.pythonanywhere.com/admin/

To view the recent stories, use the url: https://zshi3.pythonanywhere.com/news/

# **Key Feature**
Given the extra time, I added some styling to the page.
Additionally, I added the functionality for the 3 most recent stories to be displayed (if they exist) on the news page. The user can then press the button 'View Three More Stories...'.
This will call a function that uses AJAX to display the next 3 stories.
